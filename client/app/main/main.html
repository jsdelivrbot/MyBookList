      <td>Set in a fictional town in northern Russia, where highly classified research in magic occurs, the
        | novel is a satire of Soviet scientific research institutes, complete with an inept administration,
        | a dishonest, show-horse professor, and numerous equipment failures. It offers an idealistic view of
        | the scientific work ethic, as reflected in the title which suggests that the scientists'
        | weekends are nonexistent.
